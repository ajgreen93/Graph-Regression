2.14.19.NotesForWeek: Defines test error,
works through a decent chunk of the proof to show
test error for the kNN-TV statistic.

2.21.18.NotesForWeek: Several attempts are made to
establish a worst-case testing risk for the graph-LS statistic.
Attempt 3 is the most fruitful; we show the r-radius graph is
spectrally similar to a grid graph.

5.15.19.NotesForWeek: Provides a bound on the worst-case Type I
error of the Laplacian smooth statistic in terms of
C(n,r) and r. Includes one useful lemma towards bound
approximation error.

5.29.19.NotesForWeek: Shows that the T_S statistic, under
the alternative, increases at rate n^{-1/2d}.

6.5.19.NotesForWeek: Shows that discretization error, w.r.t
the grid, is of order n^{-1/d}. Shows that the rate of n^{-1/2d}
for the T_S statistic is tight (if we allow a 'bad' function
to be defined w.r.t the design.) Shows that this rate can be
beaten by a sieve estimator.

7.17.19.NotesForWeek: Establishes an estimate on the discrete Sobolev norm
over an r-neighborhood graph of a W^{1,2} function, on the order of
n^2 r^{2+d}. 

11.8.19.NotesForWeek: Testing rates for two-sample problem
in terms of Pi_max.

11.11.19.NotesForWeek: A lower bound on the empirical
norm as a function of L2 norm for bounded functions.

12.20.19.NotesForWeek: An upper bound on the expected graph Sobolev
seminorm.

1.3.20.NotesForWeek: A lower bound on the eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian.

1.16.20.NotesForWeek: Higher order graph regression testing over
Hoder classes.

1.22.20.NotesForWeek: Bound on graph Sobolev seminorm and
empirical norm for Sobolev functions.

1.30.20.MeetingNotes: Testing rate, random design, over compactly supported higher-order Sobolev functions, complete proof.

1.30.20.NotesForWeek: Testing rate, grid design, over first-order Holder functions.

2.7.20.NotesForWeek: **Corrected** bound on graph Sobolev seminorm under zero-trace assumption.

3.5.20.NotesForWeek: Approximation error, grid design, continuum Sobolev functions.
